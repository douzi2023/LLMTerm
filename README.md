## LLMTerm
LLMTerm is an SSH-accessible virtual terminal powered by a Large Language Model.

# However, it does'n work by now due to some problems I cannot solve.😭😭😭

## 🌐 Overview

LLMTerm allows users to connect through SSH and interact with a simulated terminal environment driven by an AI model (LLM).  
It behaves like a normal shell — you type commands, it responds — but everything you see is generated by an intelligent model that understands context, commands, and human intent.

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 **LLM-powered shell simulation** — responds to commands like `ls`, `cat`, or custom tasks.
- 🔐 **SSH-compatible access** — connect using any SSH client.
- ⚙️ **Configurable backend** — swap models, adjust temperature, and control behavior.
- 💬 **Streaming output** — experience realistic command-line feedback.
- 🧩 **Extensible design** — easily integrate custom commands or plugins.

## 🧰 Usage
1. Generate an SSH host key (if you don’t have one):
   ```
   python ssh-keygen.py
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```
3. Connect from another terminal:
   ```
   ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
   ```
You’ll enter an AI-simulated shell environment.
Try commands like:

```bash
ls
cat /etc/motd
echo "Hello from the matrix"
```

## 🧩 Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐
│ SSH Client  │  ←→  AsyncSSH Server  ←→  LLM Engine  ←→  Response Generator

The SSH layer handles secure connections, while the LLM engine processes user input and generates intelligent responses.

## 🔮 Future Plans

* File system
* User session memory
* Fine-tuned shell role models
* Web terminal bridge
